             <h1>The LinkedIn Bots</h1>

            <h2>How will you identify a bot on LinkedIn? </h2>

            <p class="main-text">
                It is important to differentiate between a bot and a genuine profile. If someone looks interested in connecting with you, you may contact them for sure, else ignore the one which is bots. <strong>We are discussing a few ways you can identify a bot on LinkedIn:<br></strong> 



    a) <em>Incomplete profile</em>-  When you encounter a profile that has few details in their profile or missing employment details, incomplete information about the person. Just give a thought that why would someone join lots of groups and contacts without providing any details about their employment. There is a huge possibility of it being a bot just to gather volumes of profiles in a short time. <br> 



    b) <em>Check profile pictures</em>- If the profile images are very gorgeous, looks unreal then you can figure out it through google image search, you will get the source of the image and it will tell you whether the person has purchased the image from the stock.<br>  



    c) <em>Very few or no recommendations</em>-  Every genuine profile must have some recommendations. If you find a profile with no recommendations, you don't have a clue about the profile and we suggest you not to connect with such a profile.<br>  



    d) <em>Fewer connections</em>- Profiles with fewer connections can be bots and not genuine ones. Avoid getting connected with profiles less than 40-50 connections.<br> 



    e) <em> Fake identities</em>- You must have heard about getting connection requests from profiles of CEOs and directors of well-known companies, then it is found out shortly that the real profile also exists on LinkedIn. These profiles look suspicious and require to be investigated and searched over the internet. They may be frauds asking you to click on a link  for providing personal information  and payment  to register for a job vacancy or promotions, get rich quick schemes, etc. <br>

        <h3>Disadvantages of bots   </h3>
            <p class="main-text"> 

    We know that many of you might think that using Bots will automate a lot many things in their business software and their LinkedIn accounts like sending personalized messages and email to contacts, connect with more people, validating the connections in your contact list, etc. which is very true. Therefore, you may want to install bots in your tools. <u>But let us inform you there are disadvantages of using bots which you do not want it to happen.</u> They are as follows:<br> 



    I) Using bots may lead to your LinkedIn account deleted or ceased because you will be breaching the terms and conditions you agreed while you signed up for the LinkedIn account. We don't think anybody will want that to happen.<br> 



    II) If you connect with a lot of many users just to send them text messages, emails, LinkedIn messages and spams then you are not going to achieve anything. It is a bad business practice just to disturb them with spams.<br>  



    III) While performing online marketing, you have to be careful about what they are doing and how, the contents being shared, how the company is represented to the users. A little imperfection can lead to a negative impact on your business.<br> 



    IV) The original content that you are adding to the LinkedIn account will not get many views, the reason behind this is when you post the content it is sent to your 1st- degree connections, only if they like your content LinkedIn will pass on to 2nd and 3rd- degree connections. If people do not like what you have posted , they won't care about interacting. Ultimately, your content will get very low reach and LinkedIn will mark your content as poor.
